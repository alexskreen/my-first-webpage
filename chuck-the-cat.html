    <p>This is a photo of chuck the day we got him. He climbed up into a tree and wouldn't come down. </p>
    <h2 class="important">Where do I even begin</h2>

    <div class="my-class">We adopted him 4 years ago. He was only <i>one year old</i> at the time.
      He is 5 years old now, but you can't tell because he literally doesn't age.
      For christmas we adopted a sister for him since he seemed a bit lonely</div>
