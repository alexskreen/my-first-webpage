    <h1>Misfits are the greatest band of all time</h1>

    <p class="my-class">Misfits are an American punk rock band often recognized as the progenitors of the horror punk subgenre,
    blending punk and other musical influences with horror film themes and imagery.
    Founded in 1977 in Lodi, New Jersey, by vocalist, songwriter and keyboardist Glenn Danzig,
    and drummer Manny Mart√≠nez. Eventually Jerry Only joined on bass guitar and Danzig and Only
    were the only consistent members throughout the next six years, during which they released
    several EPs and singles, and with Only's brother Doyle as guitarist, the albums Walk Among Us (1982)
     and Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood (1983), both considered touchstones of the early-1980s hardcore punk movement.
     The band has gone through many lineup changes over the years, with bassist Jerry Only being the only
     constant member in the group.</p>
